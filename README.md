_Disclaimer: The following notes are a mesh of my own notes, selected transcripts, some useful forum threads and various course material. I do not claim any authorship of these notes, but at the same time any error could well be arising from my own interpretation of the material._

**Contributions are really welcome**. If you spot an error, want to specify something in a better way (English is not my primary language), add material or just have comments, you can clone, make your edits and make a pull request (preferred) or just open an issue.

For an implementation of the algorithms _in Julia_ (a relatively recent language incorporating the best of R, Python and Matlab features with the efficiency of compiled languages like C or Fortran), see the companion repository [Beta Machine Learning Toolkit (BetaML)](https://github.com/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl) (and if you are looking for an introductory book on Julia, have a look on [my one](https://www.julia-book.com/)).

BetaML currently implements:
- Linear, average and kernel Perceptron (units 1 and 2)
- Feed-forward Neural Networks (unit 3)
- Clustering (k-means, k-medoids and EM algorithm), recommandation system based on EM (unit 4)
- Decision Trees / Random Forest (mentioned on unit 2)
- _many_ utility functions to help prepare the data for the analysis, sample the data or evaluate the algorithms

**NEW 2022**: You may be interested in a new whole MOOC on [_Scientific Programming and Machine Learning with Julia_](https://sylvaticus.github.io/SPMLJ/) that covers most (but not yet all) of the topics in MITx_6.86x, with somehow a different approach, prioritising more intuition and code implementation.
